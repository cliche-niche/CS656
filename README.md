This repository contains documents related to the course CS656 (2023-24 II Sem.) at IITK. Below are some remarks regarding each document:
+ [Notes](./Notes/): Digital notes that I made using the slides provided by the Instructor ([Prof. Sunil Simon](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/simon/)). They were split into two parts for convenience (and size constraints), with [CS656-1](./Notes/CS656-1.pdf) containing notes on Game Theory and [CS656-2](./Notes/CS656-2.pdf) containing notes on Mechanism Design.
+ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07279): We were supposed to present a paper (assigned by the instructor) in a team of three, and write a report on it towards the end of the course. My teammates were Akanksha ["s-akanksha"](https://github.com/s-akanksha) Singh, and Soham ["CrypthiccCrypto"](https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto) Samaddar. <br>
  Our paper was titled "Fairly Dividing Mixtures of Goods and Chores under Lexicographic Preferences", by the authors, Hadi Hosseini, Sujoy Sikdar, Rohit Vaish, Lirong Xia. Some mistakes in the paper were found and rectified by our group, more details provided below. 
+ [Presentation](Presentation.pdf): The presentation we made for the paper assigned to us. Please note that we were in the process of rectifying the mistakes found in the paper when we made and presented this. Specifically, the presentation claims that an MMS allocation does not exist in some cases, but this claim is incorrect and we provided a proper analysis in our report. <br>
  At the end of the presentation, you can find an homage to [MatPat](https://www.youtube.com/c/GameTheorists/). [Soham]((https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto)) and I decided to include it since we grew up following the channel(s), and MatPat had announced retirement only a few months ago (with respect to the presentation).
+ [Report](Report.pdf): This is the report we made on the paper, mainly including our understanding of the results mentioned in the paper, some alternate interpretations/proofs, and lastly some counter-examples and fixes to the errors we found in the paper. A special shoutout to [Soham]((https://github.com/CrypthiccCrypto)) since we worked on these together because I was skeptical about some arguments provided in the proofs of the paper. A detailed analysis can be found in the document.
